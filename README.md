# Otter Drift API

Backend API server for **[Otter Drift](https://github.com/dchapman1988/otter_drift)**, a Flutter/Flame mobile game where players navigate as an otter to avoid logs, collect lilies and hearts, and compete for high scores.

## About

Otter Drift API is a Rails 8 JSON API that handles player authentication, game sessions, achievements, and leaderboards. Built with JWT authentication and fully documented with Swagger/OpenAPI via rswag.

## Tech Stack

- **Ruby**: 3.4.6
- **Rails**: 8.0.4 (API mode)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Devise + JWT (devise-jwt)
- **Testing**: RSpec + FactoryBot + Faker + Shoulda Matchers
- **API Documentation**: rswag (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- **Web Server**: Puma

## Prerequisites

- Ruby 3.4.6
- PostgreSQL
- Bundler

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd otter_drift_api
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
bundle install
```

### 3. Database Setup

Configure your PostgreSQL connection via environment variables or accept the defaults:

```bash
# Optional: Set database connection parameters
export PGHOST=localhost
export PGPORT=5432
export PGUSER=postgres
export PGPASSWORD=your_password
```

Create and setup databases:

```bash
# Create all databases (primary, cache, queue, cable)
bundle exec rails db:create

# Run migrations for all databases
bundle exec rails db:migrate

# Seed the database (optional)
bundle exec rails db:seed
```

### 4. Start the Server

For local development with Flutter mobile app, bind to `0.0.0.0` to allow connections from the mobile device:

```bash
rails server -b 0.0.0.0
```

The API will be available at `http://0.0.0.0:3000`

For local development only (desktop browser/Postman):

```bash
rails server
```

## API Documentation

Interactive API documentation is available via Swagger UI once the server is running:

```
http://localhost:3000/api-docs
```

### Generating API Documentation

The API documentation is generated from RSpec request specs using rswag:

```bash
# Generate swagger.json from specs
RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake rswag:specs:swaggerize

# Or run specs and generate docs in one command
bundle exec rspec
```

## Testing

This project uses RSpec for testing with the following tools:

- **RSpec**: Test framework
- **FactoryBot**: Test data factories
- **Faker**: Realistic fake data generation
- **Shoulda Matchers**: Clean one-liner tests for common Rails functionality
- **rswag-specs**: API documentation testing

### Run All Tests

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

### Run Specific Test Files

```bash
bundle exec rspec spec/models/player_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/requests/api/v1/game_sessions_spec.rb
```

### Run with Coverage

```bash
COVERAGE=true bundle exec rspec
```

- **Cache**: Solid Cache storage
- **Queue**: Solid Queue job processing
- **Cable**: Solid Cable for Action Cable

## Models

- `Player`: User accounts with Devise authentication
- `PlayerProfile`: Extended player information
- `GameSession`: Individual game play sessions
- `HighScore`: Player high scores
- `Achievement`: Available achievements
- `EarnedAchievement`: Player-earned achievements
- `JwtDenylist`: Revoked JWT tokens

## Development

### Code Quality

```bash
# Run RuboCop linter
bundle exec rubocop

# Auto-fix offenses
bundle exec rubocop -a
```

### Security Scanning

```bash
# Run Brakeman security scanner
bundle exec brakeman
```

### Console

```bash
bundle exec rails console
```
